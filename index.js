// Create a function that takes as parameters the number of wins and losses of a player, then returns the result to a variable.
// Use Variables, Operators, Loops, Decision Structures and Functions
// The ranked match balance should be calculated as (wins - losses).

// If wins are less than 10 = Iron
// If wins are between 11 and 20 = Bronze
// If wins are between 21 and 50 = Silver
// If wins are between 51 and 80 = Gold
// If wins are between 81 and 90 = Diamond
// If wins are between 91 and 100 = Legendary
// If wins are greater than 100 and looses higher than 0 = Immortal
// If wins are greater than 100 and no looses = Master Higlander

// At the end, a message should be displayed:
// "The Hero has a balance of {balanceWins} wins and is at the {level} level"
